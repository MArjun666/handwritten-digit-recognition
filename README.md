# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Project Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with TensorFlow and Keras. A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter allows users to draw a digit and get a real-time prediction from the trained model.

The project involves two main components:
1.  **Model Training**: A CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits and saved to a file (`model.h5`).
2.  **Digit Recognition GUI**: A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to draw a digit on a canvas. The drawn image is then captured, processed, and classified by the loaded model, displaying the prediction and confidence score.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the application.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow pywin32
```
**Note:** The `pywin32` library is specific to the Windows operating system for capturing the canvas image. This GUI application will only work on Windows.

### 3. Train the Model
Run the training script to train the CNN model. This script will download the MNIST dataset, train the network for 10 epochs, and save the best model weights to `model.h5` in the project directory.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 4. Run the GUI Application
After the `model.h5` file has been created, you can run the GUI application.

```bash
python gui_application.py
```

### 5. Usage
1.  **Draw a Digit**: When the application window appears, use your mouse to draw a single digit (0-9) inside the white canvas area.
2.  **Recognize**: Click the **"Recognize Digit"** button. The application will process the drawing and display the predicted digit and the model's confidence level on the right.
3.  **Clear**: Click the **"Clear Canvas"** button to erase the drawing and try again.

## Project Components
*   **`train_model.py`**: The script for training the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
*   **`gui_application.py`**: The script for the Tkinter GUI that allows users to draw digits and get predictions.
*   **`model.h5`**: The saved model file generated by `train_model.py` (this file will appear after training is complete).

## Libraries Used
*   **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations and image manipulation.
*   **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface.
*   **Pillow (PIL)**: For capturing and processing images.
*   **pywin32**: For interacting with the Windows API to capture the screen area of the canvas.
